Some things to remember:

From man hugs:

C INTERFACE
       On  the  x86,  PowerPC  and  Sparc architectures, Hugs
implements the part of the Haskell 98 Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
that allows Haskell functions to call C routines.  Modules containing
such foreign declarations must be compiled using the ffihugs command
with  the +G  option.   Additional arguments for the C compiler may be
supplied with +L options.  For example, suppose you have some C
functions in test.c and some FFI declarations for those functions in
Test.hs and the code in test.c needs to be compiled with  -lm.   Then
you  would compile the module with the command 

              ffihugs +G +L"test.c" +L"-lm" Test.hs

which generates an object file Test.so.  Then when hugs loads Test.hs,
it will also load Test.so.
