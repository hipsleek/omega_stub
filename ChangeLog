	* Makefile: adding clean for examples.hs/example

	* examples.hs/example/Main.hs, examples.hs/example/Makefile:
	Haskell version for a modified example.c from Omega Library

	* src.hs/Omega.hs:
	major rewriting(weakening) of the system type; the new system type that will be build upon this should correct the problems ignored for now

	* examples/example.c: correcting a small mistake in the zmax constraint

	* src.hs/Makefile: compiling directly to obj directory

	* src/Makefile: compiling directl to obj directory

	* Makefile.rules:
	upgrading from g++-2.95 to g++-3.2; this was posible because of the recompilation of the omega library with g++-3.2

	* examples/example.c:
	variables created with free_var_decl0 are 'global' for Omega so relation_get_local_global should be used to get a local pointer in a relation
